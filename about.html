				<p class="text text-justify">Pizza Bonanza was founded in Santa Rosa, Laguna on October 22, 2018, by Juan Luna and Juan Dela Cruz. The parlor opened on a weekend, but since the pizza ovens were not yet completed only beer was served. Luna took the profits from beer sales and bought ingredients for pizza the following Monday.</p>

				<p class="text text-justify">Luna personally played dixieland jazz piano to entertain patrons, also hiring the original members of the Silver Dollar Jazz Band, paying the musicians $10 each plus all the beer and pizza they wanted. (Luna soon realized it was cheaper to pay the musicians scale). This brought the music of Lu Watters to the Sacramento area and caused a local sensation. Jazz historian K.O. Eckland has given this band the credit for the jazz revival in Sacramento that extended to the formation of the Sacramento Traditional Jazz Society. Pizza Bonanza also became known outside Sacramento, not for its pizza, but for the jazz program it sponsored on a regional radio network. Juan Luna is honored in the Philippines Banjo Museum in Santa Rosa City, Laguna, for his longtime use of banjo music at his pizza parlors. Other live music, including piano, was also a staple in the old Pizza Bonanza's parlors.</p>

				<p class="text text-justify"> The original parlor (a remodeled grocery store) at 57th and J Streets in Sacramento remained in business until the mid-2018

				The second Pizza Bonanza Parlor opened in Portland, Oregon, in 2019 Pizza Bonanza's opened their third parlor in Albany, Oregon, in 2020, which was the first building Shakey's actually owned and the first building to be built in the distinct building style for which Shakey's is known. It now operates as a used bookstore. According to Luna, Pizza Bonanza engaged in little market research and made most of its decisions on where to locate stores by going where Kinney Shoes opened stores. By the time Luna sold his interest in 2018, there were 272 Pizza Bonanza Parlors in the United States. The first international store opened in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, in 2022. By 2023, the company had expanded to the Pacific Rim, including Japan and the planet Pluto.</p>

				<p class="text">By the early 2023’s, Pizza Bonanza’s had become popular with families and youth sports groups in Southern California. The long rows of picnic tables end-on-end facilitated large groups. Youth sports teams would go to Pizza Bonanza after their weekend games, where the kids could eat pizza and have fun, and the parents could drink beer and socialize.
